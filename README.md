Patient Hospitalization Prediction Project:
Problem description:
In this project we are interested in identifying patients who are more likely to be hospitalized for more than 10 days within a given period based on their past medical history and demographic information.
Identifying these patients is important because if we have enough patient of similar need and nature, hospitals can provide specialized care to these patients. In particular, this information will help hospitals match these patients with their primary doctor so that personal care can be provided in the hospital. Also, for patients who do not have primary doctor but is likely to be hospitalized for more than 10 days, we can recommend them to enrol in the program.

There are two aspects to the problem:
1.Finding the right person and assigning them to their  primary doctor
2.Determining which patient is likely to sign up for this program

Impact: This will help hospitals be more effiecient.
